# pmdrc-randomizer

A randomizer for the GBA game "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team".

This is a whole new randomizer, based on the [old](https://github.com/Suguivy/pmdrc-randomizer-old), but includes a GUI and it's more user friendly.

This software is in development. The following checked elements are the features already included, and the unchecked ones are planned to be included:

- [X] Randomize Pokémon in dungeon floors *(Bosses and some parts of the Makuhita's Dojo mazes remain unchanged to prevent crashing)*.
- [ ] Randomize Pokémon moveset.

*...More coming soon...*
